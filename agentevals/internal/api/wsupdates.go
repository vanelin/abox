// wsUpdatesHandler implements GET /ws/ui-updates: a WebSocket alternative

// (agentgateway) was found to buffer - never forward - long-lived SSE
// responses (confirmed against Python's own /stream/ui-updates through the
// identical gateway, same failure, not specific to this port), while
// WebSocket's Upgrade handshake is a far more universally proxy-safe
// pattern. Both endpoints draw from the same sseHub, so an event
// broadcasts once and reaches SSE and WS clients alike - this is an
// addition, not a replacement; direct/port-forward access still works over
// SSE exactly as before. See README.md and LiveStreamingView.tsx's
// connectWS for the client side (a UI-code fork from upstream Python,
// which has no WS transport for its live feed at all).
